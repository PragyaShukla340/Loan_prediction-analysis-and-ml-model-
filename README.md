# Loan_prediction-analysis-and-ml-model-

This project involves building a ML model to predict loan approval based on various attributes of the applicants. 
<br>
Below you will find the details of the attributes used in the dataset and their significance.

## Attribute Significance

| Attribute          | Significance                          |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------|
| **Loan_id**        | Unique loan ID                        |
| **Gender**         | Male/Female                           |
| **Married**        | Applicant married (Y/N)               |
| **Dependents**     | Number of dependents                  |
| **Education**      | Applicant education (Graduate/Undergraduate) |
| **Self-employed**  | Self employed (Y/N)                   |
| **ApplicantIncome**| Applicant income                      |
| **CoapplicantIncome** | Coapplicant income                 |
| **LoanAmount**     | Loan amount in thousands              |
| **Loan_Amount_Term** | Term of loan in months             |
| **Credit_history** | Credit history meet guidelines        |
| **Property_area**  | Urban / Semi-urban / Rural            |
| **Loan_status**    | Loan approved (Y/N)                   |

### Project Description

- **Data Source:**
  <br>
  The data has been taken from kaggle it's attributes and significance of attributes are discussed above.
  
- **Analysis Goals:**
  <br>
  Build a ML Model for predicting whether the loan of the candidate(based on input data) will be approved or declined.

  **Key Findings:**
  <br>
1.We can see that approximately 81% are Male and 19% are female.
  <br>
2.Percentage of applicants with no dependents is higher.
  <br>
3.There are more number of graduates than non graduates.
  <br>
4.Semi Urban people is slightly higher than Urban people among the applicants.
  <br>
5.Larger Percentage of people have a good credit history.
  <br>
6.The percentage of people that the loan has been approved has been higher rather than the percentage of applicant for which the loan has been declined.
  <br>
7.We can infer that percentage of married people who have got their loan approved is higher when compared to non- married people.
  <br>
8.The percentage of applicants with either 0 or 2 dependents have got their loan approved is higher.
  <br>
9.The percentage of applicants who are graduates have got their loan approved rather than the one who are not graduates.
  <br>
10.There is hardly any correlation between Loan_Status and Self_Employed applicants. So in short we can say that it doesnâ€™t matter whether the applicant is self employed or not.
- **Technologies Used:**
  <br>
  The tools and technologies used by me are:
  <br>
  1.Jupyter Notebook, Python and its various in-built libraries: For cleaning and analysing data and building ML model.
  <br>
  2.Tableau : for building dashboard(for represnting data in visual format).
